Collaborative Robots in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)

## Collaborative Robots (Cobots)
Industrial robots can be defined as a programmable, self-controlled device consisting of electronic, electrical, or mechanical units which can perform a complex series of actions. 
Normally, industrial robots are defined as application specific, isolated from human workforce and possess their own working space. In contrast, collaborative robots are robots, that are designed to figure along their human counterparts and share an equivalent working space as human co-workers. Compared to industrial robots, cobots have advantages of mobility, flexibility, light weight, multi tasker, easier programmable and better computing. In industry cobots applications can be specified such as:
1. Pick and Place
2. Packaging and Palletizing
3. Quality Control
4. Finishing tasks (polishing, grinding, deburring, gluing, dispensing, welding)
5. CNC Machine Tending

## Industry 4.0
Industrial Internet of Things or IIoT is defined as machines, sensors, actuators, edges, computers and people enabling smart industrial operations using advanced data analytics for transformational business outcomes. With the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems and cloud computing, Industry 4.0 facilitates and induces advanced concepts based on the aforementioned technology to create "Smart Factories". cobots play a vital role in enabling process automation that continue evolving though software updates and their own programmability. With the advantages of Interoperability, Information Transparency, Technical assistance, Predictive capacity, and Adaptability Industry 4.0 and cobots are cruicial parts of Smart Factories.
