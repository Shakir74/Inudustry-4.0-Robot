Collaborative Robots in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)

## Collaborative Robots (Cobots)
Industrial robots can be defined as a programmable, self-controlled device consisting of electronic, electrical, or mechanical units which can perform a complex series of actions. 
Normally, industrial robots are defined as application specific, isolated from human workforce and possess their own working space. In contrast, collaborative robots are robots, that are designed to figure along their human counterparts and share an equivalent working space as human co-workers. Compared to industrial robots, cobots have advantages of mobility, flexibility, light weight, multi tasker, easier programmable and better computing. In industry cobots applications can be specified such as:
1. Pick and Place
2. Packaging and Palletizing
3. Quality Control
4. Finishing tasks (polishing, grinding, deburring, gluing, dispensing, welding)
5. CNC Machine Tending
